I'm Pains, yes that's my last name and I build software stuff. Oh, I also sometimes blog about the stuff I build at [blog.lpains.net](https://blog.lpains.net). I've been coding for way too long now so a day without code is just not a good day. How can it be?

I live in the USA, was born in Brazil and miss living in Australia. Confusing? Yes.

I code anything, really. But there is nothing better than designing an enterprise scale architecture and see the many pieces working nicely together and evolving. I've designed multi-billion dollar software systems and that was fun but I lost nearly all my hair in the process.

What else do I do? I go home and code some more. However, I got some completely unrelated passions. For instance, I am:

  * Kung Fu instructor. I studied under Grand Master Lopes in [Kung Fu Taisan](http://kungfutaisan.com.br/).
  * Taekwondo Black Belt
  * Snowboarder. Turn up the music and hit the slopes. 
  * Volleyball player. I really wanted to play professional, but apparently you need to be really good and ridiculous tall for that...
